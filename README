Fixed version of ttyrec that works on Centos 7. 

ttyrec is a tty recorder. Recorded data can be played back with the included ttyplay command. ttyrec is just a derivative of script command for recording timing information with microsecond accuracy as well. It can record emacs -nw, vi, lynx, or any programs running on tty.

ttyrec is a tty recorder. ttyplay is a tty player.

Installation:

  % make

or if your system is SVR4 system (Solaris etc.),

  % make CFLAGS=-DSVR4

or if your system supports getpt(3),

  % make CFLAGS=-DHAVE_getpt

HAVE_getpt is required if your linux system uses devfs.


Usage:

  (In the excuted shell, do whatever you want and exit)

Have fun!
